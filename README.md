# Roo

This aims to be a complete replacement for nginx, traefik, haproxy, and a lot of kubernetes. The idea is to give developers back the power and take it back from ridiculous self-complicating dev-ops.

## Complete autoconfig of docker swarm services
(Coming momentarily) @psytron

## Going Manual
Roo comes with a clustered Distributed Key-Value (KV) Store (See the API below for access). You can use this to manually configure roo.

### Schema Definitions

#### Adding a route to the routing table
```
com.roo.host:<requesting_host<:port (optional)>:scheme>  <destination_url>
```
[See an example](#a-real-example)

## API 
### Post a single key to the distributed store
```
curl -X PUT -d'test data' http://localhost:6299/roo/v1/kv/test
```
* Returns a json object { "ok" : true} if succeded
#### A Real Example Route
**Put in a test route**. For our example we are serving goole.com at our public endpoint, and routing to a swarm service with an endpoint inside our network on port 9001. The swarm stack is _cool_, the swarm service name is _game_. In docker swarm world this equates to a mesh network load balanced DNS record of tasks.cool_game. (you'll need to find your stack, service, and replace that and port 9001 with your details to get it working). The overall result to add this to our routing tables is:

```curl -X PUT -d'http://tasks.cool_game:9001' http://localhost:6299/roo/v1/kv/com.roo.host:google.com:https```

 * Note: as we don't specify a port in our requests we remove the optional port :443

To test you can run something like this (this just makes your localhost pretend like its responding to a request to google.com):
```curl -H "Host: google.com" https://localhost/```

So to summarize, google.com:443 is the incoming route to roo from the internet, and tasks.cool_game:9001 is your service and port to your internal service (in this case its an internal intranet _docker swarm_ service).

### Get a SINGLE key from the store
```
curl -X GET http://localhost:6299/roo/v1/kv/test
```
* Returns the raw bytes (you'll see this as a string if you stored it like that)
### List multiple keys from the store (Using a SCAN/Prefix filter query)
```
curl -X GET http://localhost:6299/roo/v1/kvs/te #Searches the prefix _te_
curl -X GET http://localhost:6299/roo/v1/kvs/tes #Searches the prefix _tes_
curl -X GET http://localhost:6299/roo/v1/kvs/test #Searches the prefix _test_
curl -X GET http://localhost:6299/roo/v1/kvs #Gets everything in the _entire_ kv store (filter is on nothing)
```
* Returns the rows searched using the SCAN query (in KV land its a prefix filter) in JSON
* The resulting values are encoded in base64, so you may need to convert them (unlike the GET single query above which returns raw bytes)
* Use ```window.atob("dGVzdCBkYXRh")``` in javascript. Use json.Unmarshall or string([]byte) in Golang Go if you want a string.

## TODO

* [ ] Autoscale Docker
* [ ] Autoscale Physical Infratructure
* [ ] Move flaoting IPs (Load balance, service down)
* [ ] SSL in API
* [ ] HTTP for Proxying (Only SSL Supported atm)
* [ ] Auto downgrade
